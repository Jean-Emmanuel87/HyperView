# HyperView
Introducing an intuitive and lightweight **Hyperspectral Raman Microscopy Viewer**

## Features

This fast and lightweight viewer makes it easy to display the Raman spectrum associated with each pixel of an image.

A magnifier tool is included to select each pixel with precision.

Finally, this viewer doesn’t need any specific program to be installed: any modern web browser is sufficient.
So you can simply copy the whole directory to an another computer and visualize away with another browser (you don’t even need internet connection)

## How to use

- Step 1: copy the `hyperview` directory on your machine
- Step 2: copy the main 2D image in the `data/main.png`
- Step 3: copy each spectrum at pixel (`X`,`Y`) as `data/spectrum_xXyY.png`
- Step 4: set the jobname, date, author and number of X and Y pixels in the `js/parameters.js`
- Step 5: open the file `index.html` with your favorite web browser, and Voilà!
